lws is a small websocket library for embedded applications, and in particular, jsish.
It is refactor of Andy Green's https://github.com/warmcat/libwebsockets/tree/v2.2-stable

The goal of this refactor is to:

 - simplify linking into standalone applications.
 - provide a stable subset of core features.
 - fix memory leaks.

The LICENSE is the same as the libwebsockets license, circa 2020.
