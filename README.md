lws is a small websocket library for embedded applications, and in particular, jsish.
It is fork/refactor of Andy Green's https://github.com/warmcat/libwebsockets/tree/v2.2-stable

The goal of this refactor is:

 - provide only basic websocket features
 - simplify standalone application linking
 - fix memory leaks

LICENSE is MIT, same as the libwebsockets license circa 2020.
